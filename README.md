#In this code, we used an opensource dataset that provided the information of more than 4000 people from the region of Framingham in England.
We used the logistic regression algorithm, after cleaning the dataset we ended with the information of around 3000 patients, then we divided 
it in 70% for training and 30% for test. The output that we get predicts if a person is going to have CHD in the next 10 years.
